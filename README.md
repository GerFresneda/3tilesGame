# 3tilesGame
Simple javascript game similar to tetris where the player has three blocks. A random piece appears in each block and the player has to put the pieces of the three blocks on the board in the order he wants. By putting the three pieces, another three will appear again. The game ends when one of the pieces cannot be put on the board.
